    "# Using AI to assist in coding\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently AI has been growing exponentially and it has become accessible for almost everyone. This [Ted Talk](https://youtu.be/nv9WwHpOKEg?si=TdLn_MtuUkkEvvhO) from the CEO of Github talks about how AI can be used coding. You can use AI to assist you when coding and not being able to find answers. Some AI models you can use to code are ChatGPT, Github Copilot, etc. However, it is important to note that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. AI is not all knowing and sometimes can \"lie\" (it would say something is correct when in fact is not).\n",
    "2. Sometimes it would create code that you might not understand and would make it harder to explain to yourself or colleagues. It could sometimes create a bug in your code due to misinformation or not fully understanding what you are trying to do. It is important to validate the output from the AI you use to assist you.\n",
    "3. While coding in astronomy might not influence much the everyday life of others, it is important to understand the ethics about AI and how it could further increase biases on our social system. [This short video](https://youtu.be/tJQSyzBUAew?si=WxrLWhOWXoTANjJM) explains how we have to be ethical when using AI.\n",
    "4. Take things with a grain of salt. Be critical about what the AI tells you."
